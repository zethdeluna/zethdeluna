					<p>I'm Zeth, a frontend developer with years of experience crafting engaging sites through the magical languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a sprinkle of React JavaScript/TypeScript. I love taking beautiful, aesthetically pleasing designs and turning them into real usable experiences. Outside of work, I enjoy eating good food, drinking good coffee, and strengthening my bodyâ€”throw in some Lakers basketball and a drive down PCH, then I got myself a great day!</p>
